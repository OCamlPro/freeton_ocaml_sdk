# tiny-bip39

This is a fork of the [`bip39`](https://crates.io/crates/bip39) crate with fixes for v0.6.

## Changes

See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) file, or the Github releases for specific tags.

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/tiny-bip39)

Add `bip39` to your Cargo file, and then refer to the documentation
for use.

Only an English wordlist is included at the moment, but support for
other languages is already present in the code.

A set of simple tests have been written but they only generate new
mnemonics and validate a selection of known valid mnemonics generated
by other tools
